# Description

This project aims to assist real estate agents with organizing their clients and sales leads. Real estate agents can now efficiently create and update their client information and can contact their clients all on one website. After logging in, the real estate agent will be shown a quick overview of all their clients with the option of emailing them as well. To update, create or view their clients' information, the user will be prompted to the main client database. This database will show all client information in detail and the user can update their cleint's information on the same page as well. Finally, if the real estate agent is in need of support, the user can select the contact us tab, which will direct them to contacting customer support directly.

Goals for this project:

    The purpose of this project was to deploy a full stack application utilizing all the concepts we have learned.
